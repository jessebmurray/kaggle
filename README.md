# kaggle

Code while working through the Kaggle courses. Although much of it is necessarily a retyping of the code in the Kaggle course, I take every available opportunity to go under the hood, explore other features, refer to sklearn documentation, write certain scripts myself and then compare with what kaggle has, etc.
